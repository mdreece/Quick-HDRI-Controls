## 4-1-2025: V2.6.2
	Had to rework the reset options to account for using proxies (somehow I forgot to do this)
	Added version and preferences access to not initialized panel for quick access. no longer need to initialize to access preferences.

## 3-1-2025: V2.5.9
	Updated UI for preview generation. 'Full Batch' now doesnt automatically run when clicked. Quality settings can be chosen before generation.

## 2-1-2025: V2.5.7
	Added batch proxy generation for directories in preferences

## 1-1-2025: V2.5.5
	Bug fixes with preview generation/changed error handling for generation file selection

## 1-1-2025: V2.5.4
	Proxy options added for HDRIs
	Options to have set for 'Viewport Only' or 'Both
		 - Viewport Only: When a proxy image is used for the HDRI, when a render is begun it will reset to the full resolution HDRI and will reset back to proxy when completed.
		 - Both: When a proxy image is selected and a render is begun, the same proxy will be used for rendering.
	'Proxies' folders will generate in each HDRI subfolder.
	Once a proxy is created, it will be referenced/used when a proxy is set instead of a new instance being created
	Proxies can all be cleared from within preferences.
	Compression method can be adjusted (there isn't a clear advantage to either. ZIP has been more consistent on both Windows and MacOS, but wanted to keep options open)

## 15-12-2024: V2.5.2
	Preview generation tool in preferences. Use this function to create .png thumbnails of HDRIs to ease resource usage (Support creating for .hdr and .exr)
	Single File: Use this function to create a thumbnail of a specific HDRI file (output file will be in same directory as selected HDRI)
	Batch Process: Use this function to create thumbnails for a folder fill of .hdr and .exr files. The more files the longer the process will take (also depends on user selected render settings)
	Quick HDRI Controls will detect these new preview files upon next use.
	Update function to allow extraction of .zip update files. Included is the 'Preview'blend' in the addon directory that drives the main HDRI preview scene. Background processes run the rendering.

## 14-12-2024: V2.5.1

## 12-12-2024: V2.4.6
	- If you have .png preview images of your HDRI files, name them the same as the core HDRI with '_thumb.png' at the end of the name. These will be used for generating HDR previews to save resources. If you don't have png previews, the normal functions will continue. I reworked them slightly to try to be as efficient as possible.
	- Fixed a bug where accessing a subfolders subfolder, and attempting to navigate to the initial subfolder, the panel would lose options and would require 'going home'.
	- When clicking 'Reset HDRI' the panel will revert the preview to the previous HDR as well as set navigation to its directory.
	- Added function in preferences for setting a preview limit. This is to additionally assist with resources so not all previews will show, but files should still be select able if you know the names.
